<p>When you start out by doing computer vision problems in Deep Learning, you quickly run into the issue of having to deal with remote machines. Especially one&rsquo;s that have GPU designed for such tasks. When you have to deal with these headless machines that do not have a display or user interface, there is a need to learn a plethora of command line tools that are available on linux.
In order to learn more about the tools that are mentioned below you can watch these set of lectures by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z56Jmr9Z34Q&amp;list=PLyzOVJj3bHQuloKGG59rS43e29ro7I57J">Missing Semester</a> or follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LukeSmithxyz">Luke Smith</a> on youtube. Some of these tools have a big learning curve. Which is the price you pay in order to reap the rewards in the long term. However if you are someone who just wants to get things done and move along or are short of time. I will give alternate suggestions wherever applicable.</p>
<h2 id="tools-that-are-useful-for-anyone">Tools That are Useful for Anyone</h2>
<h3 id="ssh">SSH</h3>
<p>One of the very first ones would be <strong>SSH</strong> which helps you to login to a remote machine.</p>
<h3 id="vim">ViM</h3>
<p>The very next need is a text editor that can run entirely in your terminal without needing a UI. On Linux, you can choose from ViM, Nano, emacs or mcedit. Oh, if you are one of those persons who can never let go of the jupyter-notebook IDE. And would prefer running code on the remote machine using jupyter-notebooks, I would recommend you watch this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jiPeIFXb6U">I dont like notebooks</a> by AllenAI researcher Joel Grus. If you are short on time you can instead explore the VSCode IDE.</p>
<h3 id="git">Git</h3>
<p>Git is the modern code version control software. It is one of Linus Torvalds contributions to open source that he believes has an even greater impact than the Linux kernel.</p>
<h3 id="screen-or-tmux">Screen or Tmux</h3>
<p>Code for deep learning takes hours or even days to run. Although the remote server can remain switched on all the time, you do not want your laptop switched on all the time. When you disconnect your ssh connection or close the current terminal, you kill all associated programs that are running. How do you keep them running even when you close your terminal and log out of the client machine (your laptop)? Using programs like <code>screen</code> or its modern variant <code>tmux</code>.</p>
<h3 id="conda">Conda</h3>
<p>Conda can be installed through either of the distributions Anaconda or Miniconda. Conda might be frustrating at time with the time taken to install packages. Use conda to install mamba and then use mamba in place of conda for all package installations. There are times when you might have to use pip. For example when the package is not there in conda. Or you need to install a package directly from it&rsquo;s git version. But in all other cases you are much better off using conda for environment management because it can version control non Python software as well. You often require non Python software for compiling python packages.</p>
<h3 id="research-reading--writing">Research Reading &amp; Writing</h3>
<p>Use markdown files for quick documentation. There are note editors that can read and render markdown like Obsidian, Logseq, Notion etc. Even ViM has some basic support for markdown. Use LaTeX for academic document preparation. Use Zotero for storing, annotating research papers and exporting the references as a bib file for use in LaTeX citations.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-specific-tools">Machine Learning Specific Tools</h2>
<h3 id="tensorflow-of-pytorch">Tensorflow of PyTorch</h3>
<p>Both are great frameworks that are being actively developed. One pitfall that I have fallen into is thinking that the framework that makes it easy to write code is the best. This might not always be the case. Maybe it is good for the engineer who is playing with ready made stuff but not so good for the researcher who needs to look into the internals of the code they are running. PyTorch might be a tad better for the beginner than tensorflow in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="wandb">Wandb</h3>
<p>Being able to capture the learning process is important to troubleshoot problems with the learning. You can visualize the training loss in each iteration of your epoch and monitor the validation loss after every epoch. You can also look into how the weights are changing. Or you could use model attribution techniques to create heatmaps etc.</p>
