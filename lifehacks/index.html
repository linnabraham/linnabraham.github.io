<p>Life is mostly a game of achieving the best of both worlds (or many worlds).
Here are some of my recommendations for someone who wants to run multiple tasks at a time but also seeks perfection in all that they do.
There is something called the Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology as made famous by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done/dp/0143573195">David Allen</a> in his book of the same name. If you find the book a bit dry, watch videos by people on youtube like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal">Ali Abdaal</a>. Two other interesting books to read are <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport.</p>
<h2 id="use-amplenote">Use Amplenote</h2>
<p>Amplenote is an app that goes hand in hand with the GTD methodology.
Before coming to Amplenote my workflow involved seperate apps for journalling (Obsidian or Logseq), task-management (Trello or Taskwarrior) and calendar (google calendar).
Amplenote is designed to do all these at the same time and it also has a mobile app that is easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="the-technique-in-brief">The technique in brief</h2>
<p>Identify the most important projects that you need to work on based on your values and goals in life.
Keep in mind that what competes with your goals are often, your other goals.
For collaborative projects if you have regular group meetings, create a meeting minutes document where you log the important points that were discussed. Create a condensed version of this in your notes. Turn any actionable item to a task.
Use the calendar blocking technique to block it on your calendar.
Keep a work log for each project where you document the progress you made each day and your thoughts on it.</p>
