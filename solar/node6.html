Interior of the Sun vs. The Solar Atmosphere</A>
</H2>
It can be seen from theoretical calculations that the matter in the interior of the Sun should exist in the plasma state of matter. 
However by calculating the mean free path inside the Sun and the sizes of the constituent particles it can be seen that the plasma in the Sun
behaves like a perfect gas.
Considering the densities and temperatures inside the Sun it can be seen that most of the Sun's interior is opaque. This means direct probes of the Sun's interior is very limited.

<P>
The part of the Sun from which photons can directly escape into space is called the atmosphere of the Sun.
It consists of the Photosphere, Chromosphere and Corona.
The part of the Sun that is directly visible to us is called the Photosphere.
It is interesting to note that the high energy gamma rays generated by nuclear fusion in the Sun's core takes 1,70,000 years to reach the photosphere. Where the collisions brings the wavelength into the visible regime.
