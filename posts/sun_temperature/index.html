<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>It is often humbling to think how far humanity has reached in its
efforts to understand the cosmos. Using the systematic knowledge
building methodology that we call Science, we humans have been able to
find distances to the Sun, moon and planets. Weigh the Earth while
living on just a tiny sliver of its surface called the crust. Weigh the
Sun and find the temperature and pressure in it&rsquo;s interior. Most of this
was done before the time of rockets and satellites with just pen, paper
and the equations of science. In this article let us retrace the path
that has been taken by several great thinkers and scientists who
contributed to the repository of knowledge that we have today. The
primary question we want to address is how hot is the Sun? We have seen
iron rods glowing red and white when heated. If so, then how much more
hot must the Sun be ? What is the temperature on its surface as well as
in it&rsquo;s core?</p>
<h2 id="how-far-away-is-the-sun">How far away is the Sun?</h2>
<p>From Kepler&rsquo;s third law of planetary motion, we know that
</p>
$$T^2 \propto a^3$$
<p> Where T is the orbital period of a planet around the
Sun and a is the semi-major axis of the orbit. By taking ratios one can
convert this to an equation.
</p>
$$\frac{T_1^2}{T_2^2} = \frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3}$$
<p> Now let us put Earth as
the second planet and Venus as the first planet. We define the Earth&rsquo;s
orbital period around the Sun as one year and its semi-major axis as one
astronomical unit (AU). This allows us to calculate the distance from
Venus to Sun in terms of AU if we know the orbital time period of Venus.
</p>
$$T_1^2 = a_1^3$$
<p> For the purposes of this discussion, let me call the
semi-major axis length itself as the distance. Since the orbital period
of Venus can be found by observations, we can find the distance between
Venus and Sun in terms of AU. One minus this distance would then give
the distance between Earth and Venus in terms of AU. Now consider what
happens during the Venus transit, that is, when the Venus comes directly
between the Sun and Earth. If at this time, we measure the actual
distance from Earth to Venus, we can find out the length of one AU. Such
a distance measurement can be done using the parallax method. Doing all
the calculations we arrive at an answer of 150 million kilometers for
the length of one AU.</p>
<h2 id="how-big-is-the-earth">How big is the Earth?</h2>
<p>One of the best arguments for the round-earther&rsquo;s claim of a spherical
Earth is that the shape of the Earth&rsquo;s shadow on the moon is circular
during any lunar eclipse. During a lunar eclipse, the Sun illuminates
the Earth from behind and its shadow fals on the moon. Regardless of
when or where this happens, the shadow is always circular and a sphere
is the only shape that fits such a scenario. This fact was known during
the time of Erastothenes, who lived a very long time ago and which is
evident from the name alone. We know that the Sun is so far away that
the light rays coming from it are parallel. Erastothenes also assumed
this to be true and went about calculating the Earth&rsquo;s radius based on
this assumption. He found out that at the same time when the Sun is
directly overhead at Syene in Egypt, the Sun cast a shadow that is 7
degrees inclined from the vertical at Alexandria. By knowing the actual
distance from Syene to Alexandria and the angular distance of 7 degrees,
the circumference of the Earth can be calculated. The final answer is
6371 km.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-know-the-suns-mass">How do we know the Sun&rsquo;s mass?</h2>
<p>Henry Cavendish (1731-1810) is the man credited with weighing the Earth
for the first time. He did this by measuring the gravitation constant
that appears in Newton&rsquo;s Law of Universal Gravitation. He was able to do
this because the radius of the Earth was already known by that time.
Knowing the Earth&rsquo;s mass makes us one step closer to finding the mass of
the Sun. We know that the Earth goes around the Sun in a sort of
circular motion. The centripetal acceleration is provided by the force
of the Sun&rsquo;s gravitational attraction on the Earth. The centripetal
acceleration in uniform circular motin is given by \(\frac{v^2}{r}\).
Where v is the speed of Earth&rsquo;s motion around the Sun. The speed of
Earth&rsquo;s motion around Sun is trivial to find once we know the
circumference of the Earth&rsquo;s orbit. We divide that quantity by the time
taken for one full revolution which is one year. By equating this to the
force of gravitation between Sun and Earth, we can find out the mass of
the Sun since we already know the mass of the Earth and the Sun-Earth
distance.</p>
<h2 id="the-blackbody-temperature-of-the-sun">The blackbody temperature of the Sun</h2>
<p>A blackbody temperature or effective temperature of an object is the
surface temperature that the object would have if it were a perfect
blackbody. This effective temperature can be found if one knows the
luminosity of the blackbody and its surface area, using the
Steffan-Boltzmann law. The luminosity is defined as the total power
radiated by the object. A related term, apparent brightness or received
energy flux, is the power per unit surface area of the detector. This
can be computed by diving the total power incident on your detector by
the total surface area of your detector which would depend on your
aperture size etc. This apparent brightness is affected by the true
luminosity of the object as well as the distance to the object. For an
isotropically radiating object this relationship can be expressed as,
</p>
$$\textrm{Apparent brightness} = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}$$
<p> Where L is the
luminosity, and d is the distance to the object.</p>
<p>To calculate the effective temperature for the Sun, we need to know its
linear size, that is the Sun&rsquo;s diameter. Since the distance to the Sun
is already known, by knowing the angular size of the Sun, i.e. the angle
subtended by the Sun on the sky, we can compute its linear size. Since
the Sun is very far away, the angles involved are quite small so that we
can use the small-angle approximation to find this. Doing all this we
get the Sun&rsquo;s effective surface temperature to be 5,800 K.</p>
<h2 id="the-suns-core-temperature">The Sun&rsquo;s core temperature</h2>
<p>By knowing the Sun&rsquo;s mass and volume we can estimate the pressure in the
Sun. By doing the calculations we find that the pressure is so high that
matter can only exist in the plasma state. That is, atoms are stripped
of all its electrons. Such a plasma is however electrically neutral on
the whole and the inter-particle distances are sufficient for it to have
a perfect gas behaviour. This allows us to estimate the temperature of
the plasma from the perfect gas law provided we first find out the
pressure at the core. The perfect gas law states that \(P = nkT\), where P
is the pressure of the gas, n is the number density of particles and T
is the temperature. Using the law we find the temperature at the Sun&rsquo;s
core to be \(1.5 \times 10^7\) K or 15 million degrees Kelvin.</p>
