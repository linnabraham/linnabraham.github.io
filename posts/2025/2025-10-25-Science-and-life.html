    <h2> What is Science to me?</h2>
    From a practical point of view, Science enables me to do, anything that I want to do in my life - better. It is a methodology for seeking truth, one that has time and again demsonstrated its power by enabling human civiliazation to progress.

    <h2> Personal Journey </h2>
    <p>
    I have had an interest in Science from as early as I can remember. A book that fascinated me from that time was one called "A 1001 Question and Answers", which had a lot of illustrations and scientific questions. It had all sorts of things like space travel and dinosaurs etc. Another thing that I remember is that I used to love arguing with my brothers about what was morally right or wrong and on whose side was justice, when we would have fights.

      In school, I remember that Physics was one of my favourite subjects. An event that had a considerable impact on me was attending the INSPIRE Summer Camp in my 9th standard in the University of Kerala campus. Apart from meeting the eminent scientist Dr. Thanu Padmanabhan, I got to meet this interesting fellow who claimed to be an atheist, his name was Bharath Chand.

      At the time, being a Christian, I tried to defend my faith and also attack his non-belief. After having left from there, I badly wanted to understand more so that I could claim that Evolution was not a scientific theory.
      After deciding to take Physics as undergraduate degree, I never looked back.

      Another milestone event which I remember, was meeting with this guy called Toms who was a student in CUSAT when I was staying nearby in the same hostel. I came to know more about this person called C. Ravichandran, a rationalist thinker from Kerala. I started by hearing his talks on scientific issues like vaccination, alternative medicine, organic farming and the like.

    From Ravichandran, I learnt about western thinkers like Chrisopher Hitchens and Sam Harris.
    I also heard more about Richard Dawkins through him.
