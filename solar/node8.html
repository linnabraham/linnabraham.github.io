How magnetic fields complicates things</A>
</H2>
The presence of high magnetic fields on the Sun's surface were first observed by spectroscopic analysis.
Specifically the Zeeman splitting of spectral lines allows us to gauge the presence and strength of magnetic field through which light has passed before reaching the detector.
Using the Zeeman effect it was also found that Sunspots are regions of higher magnetic field than surrounding regions.
The presence of magnetic field is unavoidable once we understand that plasma which the Sun is made up of is essentially a soup of charged ions and electrons.
And we know that moving charges always create magnetic field.
However since plasma is also neutral if you consider both charges together, it is not that simple to explain.
Our best understanding of the mechanism behind the magnetic field generation is called the Dyanamo model.

<P>
The presence of magnetic fields means that the Sun's emission can no longer be understood just as a black body emission.
One observation that shows how magentic fields can complicate things is the nature of temperature distribution in the Solar atmosphere.
The temperature in the solar atmosphere instead of decreasing with height, stop decreasing when it reaches the region known as the transition regions and then rapdily shoots up. Reaching 1 million in the corona. This is called the coronal heating problem.
The presence of such high temperature leads to the presence of several emission lines in the UV and X-ray regions.
