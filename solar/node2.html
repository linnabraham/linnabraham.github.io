The Exciting Science in the Sun</A>
</H1>
The Sun is the star closest to us and hence is the best laboratory to expand our understanding about stars and stellar processes in general.
It is what drives our ambitious goal of unlocking the ultimate source of power, a.k.a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">controlled fusion reaction</SPAN>.
And which is capable of providing clean energy for the entire known future of humanity.
It can help us learn about neutrinos and several more fascinating things.
It is also the heavenly body that has the greatest influence on Earth. This impact is seen manifested in many forms. From the harmless aurorae to geomagnetic storms that are capable of deorbiting satellites and temporary power grid failures.
However there are a lot of questions that remains answered about the Sun as well.
What heats up the corona to such high temperatures? What triggers flaring activities in the Sun? and so on.
India now has its own space based solar observatory with the Aditya-L1 satellite. Several of the instruments that are present onboard open a never before seen window on the Sun.
