<p>A website is basically an HTML file on someone else&rsquo;s computer. Once you have this, then you need to have a unique easy-to-remember address to type into the address bar of your browser. This is translated into an IP address by your browser by looking up the number on the yellow pages of the internet, a process which is also called Domain Name Resolution and for which there are dedicated servers known as DNS servers.
Therefore to run a website the minimum you require is a computer and a domain name. Luckily Github provides both to you for free. A computer through <strong>Github Actions</strong> and a free domain name that includes .github.io.</p>
<h1 id="hugo-a-static-site-generator">Hugo, A static-site generator</h1>
<p>Markdown is a text formatting language invented by none other than the legendary Aaron Swartz. Instead of directly writing in html, you get to write in markdown and have software convert it into html.
<strong>Hugo</strong> is software that does this among other things. CSS is a language that was invented to stylize the content of your website.
Hugo also generates CSS files that does the beautification of your website.
It is also called a static site generator. Create a repository in github that ends with .github.io and clone it in your machine.
Copy the contents of the public folder generated by hugo to this git repo.
When you set up github actions, Github has a computer that serves the content of this repo.</p>
