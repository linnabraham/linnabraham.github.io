Sunspots</A>
</H2>
The surface of the Sun reveals that it is not a perfect orb as expected of a heavenly body acoording to a divine picture of creation.
This fact was discovered by Galileo amongst others as soon as he trained the latest invention of the day, the telescopes,  towards these heavenly bodies (see, Figure <A HREF="#fig:sunspot"><IMG  ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>).
         Note that these observations are not made directly but by projecting it onto a screen and making drawings of what was screen.
With the limited knowledge about the Sun they had at the time, many considered these spots to be other planets or as slag of the burning Sun or even opaque smoke clouds.
It was soon discovered that there is a cyclic pattern to the appearance and disappearance of Sunspots.
An observation that has finally lead to the coinage &ldquo;solar cycle&rdquo; denoting the periodic magnetic activity in the Sun.
The Sun being crucial to life on Earth, this cycle can also be seen as one of the fundamental cycles of nature. 
Interested readers may explore the popular science book &ldquo;Nature's Third Cycle&rdquo; by Dr. Arnab Rai Choudhury.
